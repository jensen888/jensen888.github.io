He is an incoming Assistant Professor at the [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://soai.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). Before joining SJTU, he worked as TopMind at Huawei (2024-2025). He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2024, where he was supervised by Prof. [Wynne Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~whsu/). During his PhD, he also worked closely with Prof. [kawaguchi kenji](https://ml.comp.nus.edu.sg/#members) (MIT) and Prof. [Qianxiao Li](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/qianxiaoli/). He holds a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), which he received in 2018.

**Research interests**:

I am currently striving to push the boundary of Deep Learning models on exploring the World, such as:
- Theory of foundational World Models;
- Universal simulator for dynamics prediction;
- Consistency, Interactions and Efficiency of Generative Wolrd Models;

Any practical ideas aiming to advance AGI from similar aspects are also welcomed.  <font color=red>We have plenty of opennings for researchers, potential PhD students and interns. Feel free to reach out and have a chat!</font>
