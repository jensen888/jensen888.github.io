I'm incoming assistant professor at [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://soai.sjtu.edu.cn/) of [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I worked as TopMind at Huawei from 2024 to 2025. I received my PhD degree in School of Computing from [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/) in 2024, supervised by [Prof. Wynne Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~whsu/) and closely worked with [Prof. kawaguchi kenji](https://ml.comp.nus.edu.sg/#members) and [Prof. Qianxiao Li](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/qianxiaoli/). Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2018. I received the Best Student Paper Award at UAI 2023.

Research interests:

I am currently striving to push the boundary of Models' ability on exploring the World, such as Interative Generative Video, Multi-modal Understanding/Generation. Any practical ideas aiming to advance AGI from similar aspects are also welcomed. Feel free to reach out and have a chat!
